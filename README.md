# SPL Biomechanical ML Feedback System

**Basic Idea:**  
This project tests multiple feedback systems—combining foundational calculation methods with Bayesian Optimization and SHAP—to identify the best performance metrics for free throw biomechanics. Foundational metrics are derived from successful shots (extracting ranges from comfortable percentiles), while SHAP values provide individualized error feedback. Bayesian optimization then explores combinations of min, max, and mean metrics to determine the highest likelihood of success. (Note: A robust model is key; I’ve achieved 83% accuracy on 125 trials.)

## Biomechanical Free Throw SHAP Feedback Application

This tool delivers interpretable ML feedback on free throw biomechanics. It not only predicts key metrics per trial but also generates a “shot meter” and detailed force plots for individual performance.

## Overview

The goal is to provide actionable, trial-level feedback based on free throw biomechanics. The unified pipeline processes input data through a predictive model, generating:
- **Global SHAP Summary and Dependence Plots** to explain model behavior.
- **Individual Trial Feedback** with a “shot meter” for performance.
- **Force Plots** that illustrate each feature’s impact.

## Automation & Workflow

The app features a fully automated repository that streamlines the process:

    Feature Engineering:
    Combines user-driven selection with automated feature generation.

    Data Preprocessing:
    Uses a custom preprocessor with SMOTE (via SMOTEN for mixed data) to balance datasets and reduce noise.

    Model Training & MLOps:
    Employs Bayesian training to select and retrain the best-performing tree-based classifier. MLflow manages experiment tracking, artifact logging, and model promotion—automatically advancing models that meet performance thresholds.

    Prediction & SHAP Feedback:
    Generates predictions and detailed SHAP insights.

    Continuous Optimization:
    Automated Bayesian retraining refines the model over time while ensuring version control and reproducibility.

## Features

- **Configurable Inputs:** Specify YAML config and CSV dataset paths.
- **Prediction & SHAP Pipeline:** One-click execution to load config, process data, run predictions, and generate visualizations.
- **Trial-Specific Feedback:** Retrieve detailed feedback and force plots by trial ID.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Sidebar options with tabs for global and trial-specific views.
- **Automated Saving:** All outputs (predictions, feedback, plots) are saved automatically.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd your-repo-folder
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Directory Structure:**  
   Verify that directories (e.g., `data/model/preprocessor_config` and `data/processed`) exist. Adjust paths in `app.py` if needed.

---

## Usage Instructions

1. **Launch the App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Configure Options (via Sidebar):**
   - **Config File Path:** Default is `data/model/preprocessor_config/preprocessor_config.yaml`
   - **Data Path:** Default is `data/processed/final_ml_dataset.csv`
   - **SHAP Plot Options:** Toggle summary, dependence, and force plots.
   - **Trial ID:** Enter a specific trial for detailed feedback.

3. **Run the Pipeline:**  
   Click "Run Prediction + SHAP Pipeline" to load data, process predictions, and generate visual outputs.

4. **View the Dashboard:**  
   Use the "Show SHAP Dashboard" tab to see:
   - Global SHAP Plots (summary/dependence)
   - Trial Feedback (detailed metrics and shot meter)
   - Force Plot (feature contributions)

## Pipeline Details

The core function (`predict_and_shap` from `ml.predict_with_shap_usage.py`) performs:
- Loading the configuration and dataset.
- Running model predictions.
- Computing SHAP values and generating summary, dependence, and force plots.
- Saving a final dataset with predictions and trial-specific feedback.

An `index_column` (typically "trial_id") uniquely identifies each trial for targeted feedback.

---

## Dashboard Functionality

The Streamlit dashboard is divided into three tabs:
- **Global SHAP Plots:** Overview of SHAP summary and dependence plots.
- **Trial Feedback:** Detailed prediction and feedback for selected trials.
- **Force Plot:** In-depth view showing individual feature contributions.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Shot Meter:** More granular feedback per performance metric.
- **Expanded Feedback Module:** Integrate additional metrics and personalized coaching tips.
- **User Authentication & Session Storage:** Maintain state across sessions for a dynamic experience.
- **API Packaging:** Wrap the model and SHAP functions into an API for real-time feedback integration.
