    "1. Finding Optimal Shooting Form/Release Point\n",
    "\n",
    "    Detailed Analysis of Body Movements: Include analysis of body kinematics (positions and velocities of limbs) at the time of release. Use joint coordinates to extract features like elbow angle, shoulder rotation, and wrist flexion at the release frame.\n",
    "    Machine Learning for Form Classification: Train a model to classify \"good\" vs. \"bad\" shooting forms using successful shot data (makes or near-makes) and compare them against unsuccessful shots.\n",
    "    Feedback Mechanism: Implement a feedback system that suggests adjustments based on the comparison of current shooting mechanics to historical optimal ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Shooting Meter Simulation (NBA 2K-Style)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Visual Feedback System: Develop a visualization tool that overlays a “meter” on shot video frames, indicating the quality of the release in real-time. This can be based on a scoring function derived from the shooting form features and ball dynamics.\n",
    "    Comfort Zone Identification: Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to identify comfortable ranges of motion based on historical shooting data for individual players.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Shot Outcome Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature Engineering for Outcome Modeling: Include additional features such as:\n",
    "        Kinetic Energy Calculation: KE=12mv2KE=21​mv2 to see if the ball had sufficient energy for a make.\n",
    "        Entry Angle and Trajectory Analysis: Analyze whether the angle at which the ball approaches the hoop aligns with optimal scoring trajectories.\n",
    "    Model Development: Build a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, XGBoost) that predicts shot outcomes based on ball speed, entry angle, release point, and body dynamics.\n",
    "    Training with Data Augmentation: Use synthetic data generation to include a wide variety of shot scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Exhaustion Levels and Energy Management\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tracking Player Movements: Use the coordinates of major joints (e.g., knees, hips) to estimate a player's exertion level using metrics like the average vertical displacement over time.\n",
    "    Velocity and Acceleration Patterns: Monitor changes in the velocity and acceleration of the player's body parts throughout a game to detect fatigue.\n",
    "    Feature Integration: Create features such as average speed and distance covered leading up to the shot to include in the predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. shot simulator: \n",
    "    if by these metrics we can simulate the shot to a nearby hoop. We can set the hoop in a set location (or when using spatial, we'd pick the location), and set it up to virtualize the experience with yolo/opencv where when you make those motions to show shooting motion, you can show where the ball might go (even without a ball in hand)."
